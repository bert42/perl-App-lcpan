Revision history for App-lcpan

0.04    2015-01-14 (PERLANCAR)

        - Use Perinci::CmdLine::Util::Config to get lcpan configuration without
          running the binary.

        - Rebuild to update TODO.md.

	- The indexer now tries to extract dist information from Makefile.PL or
          Build.PL in addition to from META.{json,yml}. This allows for more
          thorough indexing of dependencies information (as well as distribution
          name & abstract), as a lot of older releases do not include CPAN META
          files. But this also means actually executing the Makefile.PL &
          Build.PL scripts, which might have some side effects.

        - Add script: lcpanm.

        - Rename 'rev-deps' subcommand to 'rdeps'.

        - rdeps: Add options --author and --author-isnt to be able to filter by
          author. This allows you to, for example, see if a module is used by
          other authors instead of just herself.

	- Rename module/dist from CPAN::Local to App::lcpan (PAUSE
	  conflict, CPAN::Local already exists on CPAN).
